The race condition in this Go program occurs because there are two concurrent goroutines accessing 
and modifying the global variable "number" without proper synchronization. 

Specifically, the "incrementNumber" goroutine increments the value of "number", 
while the "printNumber" goroutine prints its value. Since there is no synchronization mechanism in place, 
it is possible that the "printNumber" goroutine may read the value of "number" before it has been incremented by the "incrementNumber" goroutine, 
resulting in unpredictable and inconsistent behavior.

In other words, the race condition occurs when the two goroutines execute simultaneously, 
and the order in which they access and modify the "number" variable is not guaranteed. 
Depending on the timing of the goroutines' execution, the output of the program can vary, 
and the printed value of "number" may be either the original value or the incremented value.

To prevent this race condition, the program could use a synchronization mechanism to ensure that only one goroutine can access 
or modify the "number" variable at a time.
